			<h4> The Messy Space between Analysis and Output
            </h4>
            <p>R is a fantastic language for creating interesting analyses, the results of which you often want to share with stakeholders and executives. Unfortunately, there is often a lot of work between what you do in an R Markdown file and what you want to put in a PowerPoint presentation. Cleaning charts, culling results, and creating a story are core components of the data science work, but these are often less discussed than earlier parts of the data science process. In this talk I’ll walk through the difficulties with getting data science output ready and some lessons I have learned on the topic during my career.

			<h4>Open science as a movement and the art of Openscapes</h4>
            <p>The open science movement is “a collaborative culture enabled by 
                technology that empowers the open sharing of data, information 
                and knowledge within the scientific community and the wider public 
                to accelerate scientific research and understanding” (Ramachandran 
                et al 2021). We’ve felt included in this movement through the #rstats 
                community, and argue that open data science is a powerful entryway 
                to welcome researchers to open science – one that transforms open 
                science from an aspirational idea to a tangible daily benefit for 
                efficiency, reproducibility, and collaboration. We will share how 
                Openscapes is helping to onboard more research teams to the open 
                science movement, in part through artwork to represent and develop 
                ideas to make open science more inclusive and kind.
