<center><h2>
It is with great pleasure that we announce the 
<br>
Call for Presentations for the 2023 Cascadia R Conference 
<br>
to be held in Seattle, Washington on August 19, 2023. 
</h2></center>

<br>

<center><h2>
Extended submission now open until April 8, 2023!
</h2></center>

<br>

<h2>About the conference</h2>

The goals of the conference are to showcase the interesting ways R is being used in the Cascadia region, provide learning opportunities, and connect R programmers with one another. The presentations, therefore, are a platform for promoting these ideals. 

<br>
<h2>Selection criteria</h2>

Presentations are being solicited to fill a 15-minute presentation window (3 x 15-minute talks + shared 15-minute question and answer to round out an hour-long session) as well as 5-minute lightning talks. 

Please note that Cascadia R Conference is a regional conference that focuses on R users from the Cascadia region (primarily Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and California). Submissions are welcome from those outside of the region, but priority may be given to submissions from Cascadia locations. Also, student talks will receive special consideration.

Our audience is of varying skill level and from a wide range of organizations: non-profit, academic, government, and industry. A representative volunteer will be provided the day of the conference to assist with timing, introductions, and facilitate interactions with the audience. 

Presenters are expected to comply with the <a href="/policies">code of conduct</a> of the conference.

<br>
<h2>How to apply</h2>

To apply, fill out and submit the [Cascadia R Conference Application](https://forms.gle/D574ZXNmM2Y8jWv96). Applicants must include an abstract limited to 500 words describing your presentation and how it aligns with the goals of the conference as well as contact information. 

The Call for Presentations <b>opens January 30, 2023 and will close April 8, 2023 </b>. Presenters will be notified by end of April 2023. Upon notification, presenters are expected to confirm acceptance, provide high quality headshots, and a short biography that will be included on the Cascadia R Conference website. Prior to the conference, copies of the final presentation are required to be made available to the planning committee as a back-up.

Please <a href="/contact">contact us</a> with any questions or concerns!
