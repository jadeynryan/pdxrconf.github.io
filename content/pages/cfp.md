<center><h2>
It is with great pleasure that we announce the 
<br>
Call for Presentations for the 2024 Cascadia R Conference 
<br>
to be held in Seattle, Washington on June 22, 2024. 
</h2></center>
<br>

<center><h2>
Applications are due Feb 14, 2024!
</h2></center>

<br>

<h2>About the conference</h2>

The goals of the conference are to showcase the interesting ways R is being used 
in the Cascadia region, provide learning opportunities, and connect R 
programmers with one another. The presentations, therefore, are a platform for 
promoting these ideals. Our audience is of varying skill levels and from a wide 
range of organizations: non-profit, academic, government, and industry.  

<br>

<h2>Selection Criteria</h2>

Applications are being solicited for both full 15-minute presentations and 
5-minute lightning talks. Full talks will be grouped into sessions with similar 
themes and share a question and answer period. 

Presenters are expected to comply with the <a href="/policies">code of conduct</a> 
the conference. 

Student talks will receive special consideration. Please also note that Cascadia 
R Conference is a regional conference that focuses on R users from the Cascadia 
region (primarily Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and California). 
Submissions are welcome from those outside of the region, but priority will be 
given to submissions from Cascadia locations.

<br>

<h2>How to apply</h2>

To apply, fill out and submit the [Cascadia R Conference Application](https://forms.gle/b96QqvE61AxAvtnS9). Applicants must include an 
abstract limited to 500 words describing your presentation and how it aligns 
with the goals of the conference, as well as email contact information. 

**The Call for Presentations will close February 14, 2024 at 5PM PT.** 
Presenters will be notified by the end of March 2024. Upon notification, 
presenters are expected to confirm acceptance, provide a high-quality headshot, 
and a short biography that will be included on the Cascadia R Conference website. 
Prior to the conference, copies of the final presentation are required to be 
made available to the planning committee as a back-up.

Please <a href="/contact">contact us</a> with any questions or concerns!
