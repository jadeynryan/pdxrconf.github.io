  * Seattleâ€“Tacoma International Airport ([SeaTac](https://goo.gl/maps/DYNVnVFX1Zvv9Raj9)) is the closest airport.
  * An Uber/Lyft from SeaTac to South Lake Union in ~$50. This takes at best 20 minutes and at worst 1.5 hrs depending on traffic.
  * The light rail takes you straight downtown (University St Station) in about 40 minutes with trains every 8 - 15 minutes depending on time of day. There are then a number of public transit options to South Lake Union (bus line E or 62, the streetcar) or a much cheaper Uber/Lyft.
