It is with great pleasure that we announce the Call for Presentations for the 2023 Cascadia R Conference to be held in-person and virtually on TBD 2023. All speakers must present in-person unless last-minute issues arise.

The goals of the conference are to showcase the interesting ways R is being used in the region, provide learning opportunities, and connect R programmers with one another. The presentations, therefore, are a platform for promoting these ideals.

The theme of the 2023 conference is "TBD". This is purposefully broad to allow a diverse suite of talks. Some examples of topics that would fit in this theme include:
