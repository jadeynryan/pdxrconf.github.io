It is likely that many of you have experimented with rvest and related packages for accessing (or scraping) data directly from a website, but what about performing these operations as routine tasks on a fixed schedule? For example, say you wanted to download avalanche risk forecasts and weather data at 6:00 am daily from various websites and store this information for subsequent analyses. We can accomplish this by running a given R script as a cron job (Linux/Mac) or by using the Task Scheduler (Windows) from either a desktop or server environment. This simple design pattern opens a whole world of possibilities such as enabling us to build our own real-time Shiny-free dynamic html/js dashboards by overwriting a single data file. I will also briefly discuss web scraping ethics, API endpoints and the polite.
