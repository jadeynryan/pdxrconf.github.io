Learning to write code under 'normal' circumstances can be daunting for many students, especially those in non-STEM majors. I will discuss the evolution of my approach to teaching R to non-STEM majors as a part of an introductory statistics course. The journey begins a few years ago with an attempt to string together a set of script files and the inevitable crash and burn to rmarkdown templates in a custom package.
