			<h4>The Role of Data Science in Translational Research at Fred Hutch</h4>
			<p>With recent advances in biomedical technologies, researchers at the Hutch (and elsewhere) are generating datasets at a scale we couldn’t even envision five years ago. This is in addition to the amount of publicly available data that is growing at exponential pace, that could be mined for additional biological information. At the same time, recent advances in statistics, machine learning and artificial intelligence are revolutionizing the way we think about data, and the way we analyze data. In November 2018, the Fred Hutch launched the Translational Data Science Integrated Research Center (TDS-IRC), a cross-divisional, collaborative research effort that will enable the Hutch to leverage these recent advances — and spur future innovation — in large-scale biological experiments, computational methods and infrastructure. During this presentation I will give an overview of current data science efforts at the Hutch and discuss future directions using concrete examples from our work on infectious diseases, vaccines and cancer immunotherapy.</p>
			<h4> Biography </h4>
			<p>Dr. Gottardo is a pioneer in developing and applying statistical methods and software tools to distill actionable insights from large and complex biological data sets.In partnership with scientists and clinicians, he works to understand such diseases as cancer, HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis and inform the development of vaccines and treatments. He is a leader in forming interdisciplinary collaborations across the Hutch, as well as nationally and internationally, to address important research questions, particularly in the areas of vaccine research, human immunology, and immunotherapy. As director of the Translational Data Science Integrated Research Center, he fosters interaction between the Hutch’s experimental and clinical researchers and their computational and quantitative science colleagues with the goal of transforming patient care through data-driven research. Dr. Gottardo partners closely with the cancer immunotherapy program at Fred Hutch to improve treatments. For example, his team is harnessing cutting-edge computational methods to determine how cancers evade immunotherapy. He has made significant contributions to vaccine research and is the principal investigator of the Vaccine and Immunology Statistical Center of the Collaboration for AIDS Vaccine Discovery.</p>

			<h4> R We There Yet? Building Communities of Practice Around R and Topics in Biology</h4>
			<p> R meetups and communities are thriving in cities around the world, but even identifying other R users at your workplace can be surprisingly difficult. While it's possible to develop expert-level R coding skills in isolation, it's much easier (and far more fun!) to improve your coding skills in cooperative communities of practice, encompassing users of various skills levels and working on different types of problems. What does it take to develop communities of practice at an institution or company? How do you assess what members of a community need or prefer? In this talk, I'll discuss my experiences supporting emerging communities of practice for coding skills at a large non-profit organization with many R users. I'll identify common impediments to community development, but also provide specific recommendations for facilitating and encouraging investment and cohesion in cooperative learning. </p>

			<h4> The Role of Data Science in Translational Cancer Research: From Desk, to Bench, to Bedside </h4>
			<p> Over the course of more than 40 years, we have been redefining what's possible in cancer research, and translating these findings into cures. Fred Hutch has been a pioneer of immunotherapies that have improved patient outcomes in ways we have never seen before. However, these novel therapies provide robust cures in only a subset of patients with specific types of cancer. Thus, there remain significant challenges in deciphering how to extend these cures to all cancers and all patients. To overcome these challenges, the Hutch has created the Immunotherapy Integrated Research Center (IIRC) to advance our research and increase collaboration across scientific disciplines. Here, I will discuss how we infuse data science throughout the bench-to-bedside discovery cycle to drive innovative research. </p>

		<div class="biography">
			<h4> Biography: </h4>
			<p> Robert Amezquita is a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Immunotherapy Integrated Research Center at Fred Hutch under the mentorship of Raphael Gottardo. His current research focuses on utilizing computational approaches leveraging transcriptional and epigenomic profiling at single-cell resolution to understand how novel anti-cancer therapeutics - ranging from small molecule therapies to biologics such as CAR-T cells - affect immune response dynamics. In particular, his work aims to better understand the process of immune cell differentiation under the duress of cancer as a means to inform future immunotherapies. To accomplish this, Robert works collaboratively across the center with experimental collaborators, extensively utilizing R for data analysis. Recently, Robert and colleagues published "Orchestrating Single-Cell Analysis with Bioconductor" on bioRxiv, a review focusing on single-cell RNA-seq analysis methods based in R. </p>

			<h4> How To Talk So Engineers Will Listen: R in Production at T-Mobile </h4>
			<p> When we hired the very first data scientist for the AI @ T-Mobile team, nobody in our organization used R. Less than 8 weeks later, we had R models running in production environments. In lots of organizations, R isn't valued as a "real" programming language. At T-Mobile by sitting data scientists and engineers together we have cultivated a environment of mutual respect. </p>
			<p>In this talk, we will walk through our typical engineering product development workflow at T-Mobile, where the heart of the product is a model created in R. We will also cover the differences in how engineers at data scientists work. By doing so, we hope to empower R users to consider themselves as engineers and convey the vocabulary necessary to make engineers stop and listen. </p>

			<h4> Creating Interactive GIS Applications with Shiny and Leaflet </h4>
			<p> The Shiny web application framework by RStudio enables data scientists to create and share interactive data analytics. Since Shiny was introduced in 2012, countless open-source contributors have published packages that allow R developers to use Javascript libraries in their Shiny applications. One such Javascript library is leaflet, a platform for creating interactive maps. This talk will introduce how Shiny, leaflet and other geospatial mapping packages can work together to create beautiful web applications capable of providing information-rich visualizations. This talk will also briefly touch on "Dockerizing" and deploying Shiny applications in a High Availability production environment using GCP (Google Cloud Platform). Lastly, if time permits, there will be an opportunity to demo some applications that put all these concepts and technologies together. </p>

			<h4> Surge Pricing: An Application of Segmented Regression in Marketplace Pricing </h4>
			<p> Convoy engages in a two-sided marketplace, wherein we transact with both shippers and carriers. When shipper demand for shipment services increases quickly, the carrier supply reacts by raising prices. In order to limit Convoy’s exposure to an unexpectedly large gap between the price shippers pay us and the price we pay carriers, we need to understand at what shipment volume carriers will begin raising prices, and by how much. In this talk, I will describe how segmented regression is a natural fit for identifying the surge point - the point at which prices begin rising - and the surge premium - how much prices will rise by, as a function of volume. </p>

			<h4> Bayesian NLP in R on Clinical Text: Predictions from Electronic Health Records </h4>
			<p> Healthcare in the US follows a crisis first, response second pattern. Consequences include high costs and potentially avoidable human suffering. Alternatively, many envision healthcare adopting data-informed patterns, so as to predict poor outcomes and deliver care proactively, thereby mitigating future suffering, controlling costs, and providing better care for more people. The intervention side of that vision is a vast scope and not my topic, but I will demonstrate that the predictive aspect is practical today with concrete examples and simple, transparent models constructed and visualized in R and trained on text extracted from electronic health records (EHRs).</p>
			<p>The frontier of machine learning in healthcare is the analysis of unstructured text in EHRs. Naive Bayesian (NB) modeling is a core method for machine learning, well known in document classification, for example. I demonstrate the utility of NB models, with clinical text as input, to predict hospitalizations, emergency department usage, and mortality. I discuss simplicity and transparency as factors critical to gaining the support of stakeholders in adopting models.</p>

			<h4> Time Series Forcasting with Keras: LSTM vs ConvNN </h4>
			<p> When we look for examples of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), they usually concern natural language processing. Similarly, Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNN) usually concern image processing. As such, most popular applications of deep learning are not time series forecasting. How can we then effectively apply these methods to time series forecasting? To answer this I have built hourly solar generation forecasts with different methods in Keras. As a practitioner in the power utility industry, I will talk about different deep learning architectures suitable for time series forecasting and how they compare to traditional statistical methods. </p>

			<h4> Deploying Machine Learning in R with Amazon SageMaker </h4>
			<p> Too often, data scientists build potentially high-impact models in R on their personal laptops that never see the light of day in production due to deployment obstacles. At Convoy, we leverage machine learning to manage hundreds of marketplaces each day, so building a robust and frictionless platform to deploy models is critical to our success. Convoy uses Amazon SageMaker to minimize the amount of code that data scientists need to write to go from researching and training a model locally in R to deploying the same model in production. As a result, our team has ownership over the end-to-end machine learning pipeline and can rapidly deliver impact on the Convoy product. In this talk, we'll discuss the central challenge of deploying machine learning in production, how the Plumber package allows us to serve our models in production, and the benefits that Amazon SageMaker provides in this project. </p>

			<h4> Reproducible Data Processing in Team Workflows with DataPackageR </h4>
			<p> As data is cleaned and updated throughout a research project, it can be easy for each user to generate their own versions. With many instances of data, confusion often surfaces for naming conventions (i.e., date and initial suffixes) and could result in multiple "final" versions, potentially hindering the analysis work flow and making reproducibility difficult. In this talk, I will motivate and demonstrate the use of DataPackageR: an R package that transforms the data processing pipeline into a version-controlled data package. With data packages generated by DataPackageR, raw data remains immutable, read-only input that is processed into analysis datasets once the package is built. To maintain reproducibility, pre-specified user-generated R markdown scripts are rendered, simultaneously generating processed data and documentation vignettes. The data package version is also automatically updated with each build. The R dataset can then be consumed downstream, with the data version established, by the original author, teammates, or other researchers by simply installing and loading the data package. As part of the presentation, I will demonstrate real-life application where we package laboratory-generated HIV data for downstream clinical trial analysis. </p>

			<h4> Building Data Science Infrastructure at Enterprise Level</h4>
			<p> Modern day organizations are spending considerable amount of resources in data science research and development and the need for having a dedicated data science department in house has increased exponentially. Companies are looking at external partners with dedicated competence and experience in this field to assist in building a comprehensive ‘one place all tools’ solution. We, as data science specialty consultants, have established partnerships with popular data science platforms providers like RStudio and Jupyterhub. We were brought in by a multinational leading biotechnology company to design, develop and deploy an integrated data science development platform for their team of over 100 data scientists. The ask was to build a comprehensive solution- where users can use either R and Python and to develop model and share results through a common platform.</p>
			<p>The biggest concern for us was to provide a solution which can handle multitude of user sessions, but also provide high performance computing and resources at the same time. Safe option was to build a high availability, load balanced environment, though it will create troubles in the future as numbers of users keep on increasing and resources need to be optimized. We decided to take a two-pronged approach, where a kubernetes backed containerized solution will be the primary interface and a load balanced product for backing up additional load. Users launch their own containers for each processing session and kubernetes takes care of backend resource allocations. They can run both Jupyter notebooks (through Python IDE) and R scripts(through R IDE) in the container and perform multiple assignments concurrently. The publishing platform provides a cohesive product to share results through shiny applications, HTML reports, or even python code. Connect is enabled to run both Python and R. It has also been configured to schedule reports to be sent as emails. We have also built R IDE in a load balanced High availability environment. Here R IDE’s internal load balancer works with AWS’s load balancer to accommodate backup and smooth operations in case any of the server(s) goes down. The publishing platform is also configured with high availability, which means multiple servers are simultaneously serving the user’s publishing needs by using a common database. We have also integrated a high availability Package Manager in the mix, which enables the administrator to establish control over package access and downloads. Users can also utilize Package Manager to access different versions of R packages. Our instance of Package Manager is also capable of serving internally developed packages by connecting to the original git source, which eliminates the need for additional administration. </p>

			<h4> Modeling in R to safeguard U.S. agricultural and natural resources from invasive pests </h4>
			<p> A primary goal of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) is to safeguard US agricultural and natural resources through early detection of exotic plant pests and weeds. We have developed a spatial modeling platform in R for the prediction of life cycle events (phenology) and climate suitability of invasive insect species in the continental US. This platform combines gridded weather/climate data with insect temperature response parameters to produce maps that can depict the potential range of a species and the timing of pest events (e.g., when adults will emerge and start laying eggs). Products from the model will be used to guide USDA supported trapping programs for at least 16 insect species.

			<h4> Biography: </h4>
			<p> I use R and other bioinformatic tools to study how animal and plant population dynamics are influenced by  environmental changes resulting from climate, land use, fires, and invasive species. My current research focuses on supporting agriculture by developing climate driven models for several insect pests. I am currently a Research Associate with the Integrated Plant Protection Center in the College of Agricultural Sciences at Oregon State University. Previously, I worked as an Ecologist with the US Geological Survey in Boise, Idaho, and I completed a postdoctoral fellowship in the Ecology and Evolutionary Department at the University of Arizona </p>

			<h4> Improving Performance Metrics with R </h4>
			<p> In many situations, we are limited in our choices of metrics to evaluate performance. Often, the metrics we do have are flawed, as they are impacted by factors which are not performance related. Using my development of Student Independent Performance as an example, I will show the steps to using linear or logistic regression models in R to improve performance metrics by adjusting for these factors.</p>
			<p> Student Independent Performance is a simple metric I created to better compare schools using standardized test scores. As a school's average test score is impacted heavily by the racial and class demographic of that school, I used logistic regression to filter out the variance in test scores caused by student demographics. What remains is a measure that compares the performance of schools on standardized tests independent of the demographics of their student bodies.</p>

			<h4> Analyzing Legislative Activity with R </h4>
			<p> During the 2019 session of the Washington Legislature, I used R to curate a dataset of bills and roll call vote results (i.e., capturing how each Representative and Senator voted on each bill). This involved using httr and the tidyverse to harvest data from the Legislative Service Center's XML data feed, and munge the data into data frames suitable for analysis and visualization.  I used the sf package and ggplot to create a cartogram of how legislators voted, and also performed analyses of caucus loyalty. I published results/visualizations periodically throughout the session on my Twitter timeline ( @scottcame ).</p>
			<p>This talk will provide a very quick walkthrough of the R code and a glimpse of some of the results.</p>

			<h4> Adding shine to Shiny: improving the look of your UI </h4>
			<p> Shiny is a package that makes it incredibly easy to create a graphical user interface around R code and quickly share prototypes with colleagues. By default, Shiny apps end up all having the same grey and blue look - which is boring and often comes across as sloppy. From themes to editing CSS files and even creating your own website templates, there are so many ways to improve the styling and design of your shiny app. In this talk I'll walk through these methods, pros and pitfalls. By the end, you should be ready to add some pizzaz to your apps! </p>

			<h4> Archetypal Ballers and Ternary Plots - Evaluating Basketball Players via Unsupervised Learning </h4>
			<p> Archetypal analysis is a dimensionality reduction technique that reduces an 18-dimensional box score dataset down to three dimensions by representing each player's skills as a linear combination of the skills of the extreme players - the best and the worst. Combined with ternary plot visualization, archetypal analysis offers both insight and quantitative evaluation of players and teams.</p>
			<p>This talk describes a new R package for archetypal analysis of men's and women's college and professional basketball players obtained from the web, with examples from the 2019 NCAA "March Madness" tournaments, the 2018-2018 NBA season and the 2018 WNBA season.</p>

			<h4> Bootstrapping Business / Data Transformation with R </h4>
			<p> Companies routinely lack the necessary information to make a confident decision - they instead rely on experience and anecdotes because supporting data and analytics aren’t readily available. Often these same companies hire teams of data analysts and data scientists to provide context to decision makers, but they do so without a strategy, infrastructure, IT support – much less refined requirements to execute against. This leads to analysts and data scientists executing full-stack work while trying to manage the expectations of their business partners, who rarely understand the complexities…</p>
			<p> Our team spent the last year applying a new framework to our internal operations to enable our leadership team to leverage data and analytics in their process. I will walk through this framework at a high-level and discuss how we were able use it as a tool to communicate to the business. Further, I’ll discuss how we were able to plug R into the process to bootstrap solutions that are scalable and lightweight. </p>

			<h4> Visualizing geographic data with geofacet </h4>
			<p> Data scientists often encounter data with a geographical component, such as presidential approval ratings by state, annual crime rates by county, etc.There are a number of ways to visualize geographic data but many come with limitations to effectively conveying the information. In this talk I will introduce the geofacet package, which provides a mechanism to create any type of visualization to the data for each geographic entity and then easily arrange the plots into a grid according to the underlying geography, allowing for more flexibility in creating more effective visualizations for geographic data. </p>
