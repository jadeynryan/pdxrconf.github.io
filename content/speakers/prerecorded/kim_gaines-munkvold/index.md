Land cover classification maps provide useful information related to monitoring and managing vegetation, agriculture, natural resources, and urban planning. The purpose of this prediction is to identify burned areas in the Waldo Lake Wilderness Area. On August 23, 1996, the Charlton Butte Fire was started by lightning and burned 10,400 acres of the Waldo Lake Wilderness. Fire recovery has been slow in the nearly 25 years since the fire. Two models, Ranger and K-Nearest Neighbor, from the Caret package, training points, and Landsat 8 imagery were used to create the landcover prediction. A total of 7,500 training points were used to define five classes, including burned area, forest, low vegetation, water, and road. The results of this initial modeling contained noise from the road classification.  This classification was removed quickly and easily from the final models to better visualize the burn area and vegetation. Both the Ranger and K-Nearest Neighbor models performed well, with Kappa scores ranging between 91 - 94%. These models were then tested in an untrained study area in which a fire had occurred.  This presentation is supported by slides and leaflet web maps.

__Bio:__ Kim Gaines-Munkvold recently received a GIS Graduate Certificate from Portland State University. Her work focuses on remote sensing and fire recovery.  As a native Oregonian, her favorite place to perform spatial analysis is her own backyard in Portland, or her favorite camping spot, Waldo Lake in Central Oregon. 
During her time at Portland State, Kim became fluent in a variety of geospatial processing programs and programming languages; of these, she has found that R is one of the most flexible, and thus most valuable, in her skill set. She continues to refine her skills as she partners with other PSU alumni on mapping projects.
