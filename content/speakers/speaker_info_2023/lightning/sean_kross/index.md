### Visualize Data Analysis Pipelines with Tidy Data Tutor

The data frame is one of the most important and fundamental data structures in
R. It is no coincidence that one of the leading domain specific languages in
R, the Tidyverse, is designed to center the transformation and manipulation of
data frames. A key abstraction of the Tidyverse is the use of individual 
functions that make a change to a data frame, coupled with a pipe operator,
which allows people to write sophisticated yet modular data processing pipelines.
However within these pipelines it is not always intuitively clear how each
operation is changing the underlying data frame, especially as pipelines become
long and complex. To explain each step in a pipeline data science instructors
resort to hand-drawing diagrams or making presentation slides to illustrate the 
semantics of operations such as filtering, sorting, reshaping, pivoting, 
grouping, and joining. These diagrams are time-consuming to create and do not 
synchronize with real code or data that students are learning about. In this
talk I will introduce Tidy Data Tutor, a step-by-step visual representation 
engine of data frame transformations that can help instructors to explain 
these operations. Tidy Data Tutor illustrates the row, column, and cell-wise 
relationships between an operationâ€™s input and output data frames. We hope the 
Tidy Data Tutor project can augment data science education by providing an 
interactive and dynamic visualization tool that streamlines the explanation of 
data frame operations and fosters a deeper understanding of Tidyverse concepts 
for students.
