### SimSST: An R Statistical Software Package to Simulate Stop Signal Task Data

The stop signal task (SST) paradigm with its original roots in 1948 has been proposed to study humans' response inhibition. Several statistical software codes have been designed by researchers to simulate SST data in order to study various theories of modeling response inhibition and their assumptions. Yet, there has been a missing standalone statistical software package to enable researchers to simulate SST data under generalized scenarios. This paper presents the R statistical software package "SimSST", available in Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), to simulate stop signal task (SST) data. The package is based on the general non-independent horse race model, the copulas in probability theory, and underlying ExGaussian (ExG) or Shifted Wald (SW) distributional assumption for the involving go and stop processes enabling the researchers to simulate sixteen scenarios of the SST data. A working example for one of the scenarios is presented to evaluate the simulations' precision on parameter estimations. Package limitations and future work directions for its subsequent extensions are discussed.
