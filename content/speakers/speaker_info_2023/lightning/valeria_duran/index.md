### Maximizing Performance: Strategies for Code Optimization 

Code optimization improves the performance and efficiency of a program and is essential in software development. Optimizing code involves modifying code that currently slows down a process. Identifying bottlenecks in the code is crucial in reducing the time required to process large datasets and perform computations. Deciding at what point optimization is vital, and if optimization is even needed, is an important task that any programmer will need to consider at some point. There are tradeoffs regarding code optimization, such as code readability, the time needed for modifications, debugging, and more, and weighing the benefits of optimization against these tradeoffs is essential in determining if it is worth pursuing. This talk will review what to consider when optimizing code and valuable tools.
