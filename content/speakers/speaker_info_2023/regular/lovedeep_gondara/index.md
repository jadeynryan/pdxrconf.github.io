### Using R Shiny for cancer surveillance, lessons from the trenches  

At British Columbia Cancer Agency, we have embarked on moving all of our cancer surveillance reports to R Shiny dashboards (Example: https://bccandataanalytics.shinyapps.io/IncidenceCounts/). This talk will focus on the roadmap, why we decided to move to R shiny, the challenges we faced implementing it within a public healthcare system and the outcome. The talk will touch on the pros and cons of various approaches  such as using package-based development (golem), data privacy, other add-ons needed for the apps to be functional surveillance dashboards, etc. We will end the talk with outlining further adaptation of R Shiny in the form of interactive nomograms for research studies.
