### A gRadual introduction to web APIs and JSON

Do the words "Web API" sound intimidating to you? This talk is a gentle introduction to what Web APIs are and how to get data out of them using the {httr2}, {jsonlite}. and {tidyjson} packages. You'll learn how to request data from an endpoint and get the data out. We'll do this using an API that gives us facts about cats. By the end of this talk, web APIs will seem much less intimidating and you will be empowered to access data from them.
