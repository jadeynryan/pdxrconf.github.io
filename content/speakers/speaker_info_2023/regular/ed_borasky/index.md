### Eikosany: Microtonal Algorithmic Composition with R

Eikosany is an R package for composing microtonal electronic music based on the theories of Erv Wilson. It gives a composer the ability to 

* create compositions using a wide variety of microtonal scales, 
* manipulate the scores as R data.table objects, 
* synthesize the compositions as audio files, and
* export the compositions as MIDI files to digital audio workstations.

In this talk I'll briefly describe the music theory behind Eikosany and  walk through a typical composition scenario. At the end, I'll play the resulting composition.
