### Transit Access Analysis in R

Transit agencies across the country are facing a fiscal cliff that threatens their ability to provide vital services to cities and communities. Understanding the crucial role of these networks in creating livable cities is now more important than ever. This presentation offers an intermediate-level overview of R packages and workflows for analyzing public transit networks and assessing their connectivity to amenities such as jobs, schools, parks, and stores. It showcases how to report results and outlines the necessary data inputs for this analysis. Packages like {tidytransit} enable users to access transit schedule data in the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) format, allowing them to map stops, routes, and calculate service frequency. Going deeper, packages like {r5r} combine GTFS files with OpenStreetMap street network data to model origin-destination trips based on factors like time of day, walking speed, and transfer preferences. This presentation demonstrates that these packages, alongside other essential {tidyverse} tools, empower R users with powerful resources to delve into the realm of transit planning and modern urban analytics.
