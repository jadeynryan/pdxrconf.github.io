### Transit Access Analysis in R

As transit agencies around the country face an impending fiscal cliff that imperils their ability to provide essential service to cities and communities, it's more important than ever to understand the importance role these networks play in modern making cities more livable. This presentation will give an intermediate-level overview of the small cluster of R packages and workflows that go into analyzing public transit networks and their associated access to amenities (jobs, schools, parks, stores, etc.). The presentation will also show examples of how results can be reported, and provide an overview of the underlying data inputs users will need for this type of analysis. Packages like {tidytransit} gives users the ability to pull down transit schedule data in General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) format, and from there map stops, routes, and calculate the frequency of service. Packages like {r5r} take things even deeper, using GTFS files and OpenStreetMap street network data to model origin-destination trips based on time of day and a variety of trip behavior like walking speed or transfer preferences. Hopefully, this presentation will show that, along with other core {tidyverse} mainstays, these packages give R users a set of powerful tools to fully explore the world of transit planning and modern urban analytics.
