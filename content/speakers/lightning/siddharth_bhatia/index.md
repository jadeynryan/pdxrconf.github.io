talk: "Engineering Better Shiny Apps Using Docker"

More than often, there are differences in dev environments across the team for the same app in development.Additionally, there is a perception that Shiny is better for POCs and not so much for professional web applications at scale. In this talk, audience will have a chance to learn how to make Shiny app development a part of a more professional software engineering process. They will learn how to synchronize their dev environments, locally test their apps (be it unit testing, load testing or user testing), and be part of a CI/CD system using Docker and Shiny with some help from Github Actions and Shinyapps.io. Some technologies that help scaling dockerized apps will be also be hinted as an exploratory task for suitable audience.
