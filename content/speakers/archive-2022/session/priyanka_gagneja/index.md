Key takeaway from this session would be to help you all to be able to write shorter, cleaner code that makes it more readable, making it:
+ Easier to debug in case of issues.
+ Easier to transition to & from others including your future self,

I want to highlight a few hidden gems I have recently identified, when looking to achieve something very specific. Hidden because they are always there in the documentation, which we tend to overlook as long as we are able to run the function in its basic form, without changing much of default settings, which is where we will try to dig in: 

We look into the functions, some unnoticed options, and use cases. For example, 
1. Group_by : .drop = false 
2. .before /.after in a mutate.
