The targets package facilitates reproducible workflows and reduces unnecessary duplicate computation. In this workshop, weâ€™ll cover how to structure your data analyses using function oriented workflows, set up and debug pipelines, and incorporate targets into your existing toolkit for reproducible data science. Participants should be comfortable with basic R programming including defining variables and functions.

Agenda:
- Functional programming
- Pipelines 
- Debugging
- Integrating other tools for reproducible research
