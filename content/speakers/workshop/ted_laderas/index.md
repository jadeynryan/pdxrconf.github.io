Interactive graphics and dashboards are a powerful tool for communicating your findings and enabling your audience to ask specific questions of datasets. One of the most popular tools for building such visualizations and dashboards is Shiny, an interactive visualization framework in R. Shiny visualizations and dashboards can be easily shared online.
In this workshop, Ted Laderas will introduce you to the basic concepts behind making interactive visualizations with Shiny. In the workshop, we will build a dashboard that will give users control to slice a dataset for further exploration, and also use controls to change visual properties of a visualization. We will also discuss deployment of our apps.
Please note this workshop assumes basic familiarity with R and the tidyverse and basic knowledge of how functions work in R. All levels are free to attend, but you will get the most out of this workshop if you're familiar with the tidyverse and know something about functions. An introduction to the tidyverse can be found [here](https://r-bootcamp.netlify.app). A quick review of functions can be found [here](https://laderast.github.io/gradual_shiny/introduction.html#functions-in-r)
