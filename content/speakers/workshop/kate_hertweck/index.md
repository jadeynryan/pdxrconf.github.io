New to R statistical programming? Join this introductory R workshop in a whirlwind tour of R for data manipulation and visualization! We'll apply widely used tools from the Tidyverse collection of packages in the RStudio interface to jumpstart your data science work using R.
At the end of this session, you will be able to:
- recognize important features of R coding syntax
- import, inspect, and manipulate spreadsheet-style data
- create publication-quality visualizations of data
- organize R coding within projects for reproducibility
