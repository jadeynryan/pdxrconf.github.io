This tutorial aims to teach some basics of R package development while creating all the necessary documentation to support a validation. By the end of this tutorial, you will know how to apply the R Package Validation Framework to your internal R packages, and apply the {valtools} package.

This tutorial addresses a major knowledge gap in the R ecosystem: getting R accepted into highly regulated industries. This is an opportunity for those that work in these industries to be empowered to expand the use of R. We are taking an approach where some basic R knowledge is expected, such as writing scripts and functions, but teaching people to take the next steps.

Previous work presented to the community has shown a framework for developers to distribute validation-ready R packages, which has been met with enthusiasm among R users in pharma. In this tutorial participants will experience the process of creating R packages with validation resources in place and explore how addition of these materials perform in a variety of real-world scenarios, including validation-on-install and validation-post-install. Participants will have the opportunity to practice how validation affects subsequent package releases.
