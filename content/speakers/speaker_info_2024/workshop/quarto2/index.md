#### Friday June 21, 2024
#### 1:30 - 4:30 PM  
#### Room C123A

The Intro Quarto workshop takes you through the basics of authoring a reproducible report using Quarto. This workshop builds on those concepts and teaches you how to level up your reproducible reports by using parameters, conditional content, conditional code execution, and custom styling sheets for HTML and Microsoft Word formats. Additionally, you will learn how to render all variations of a parameterized report at once using `quarto` and `purrr`.

**Knowledge Prerequisites**: The workshop is designed for those with some experience in R and R Markdown or Quarto. It will be assumed that participants can perform basic data manipulation and visualization. Experience with the `tidyverse`, especially `purrr` and the pipe operator, is a major plus, but is not required.

**Pre-Installations**: Recent version of <a href="https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/">R, RStudio</a>, and <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/">Quarto CLI</a>. Packages used in exercises include `dplyr`, `fs`, `ggplot2`, `here`, `janitor`, `knitr`, `lubridate`, `plotly`, `purrr`, `quarto`, `readr`, `rmarkdown`, `stringr`, and `tidyr`.

```
install.packages(c("dplyr", "fs", "ggplot2", "here", "janitor", "knitr", 
                   "lubridate", "plotly", "purrr", "quarto", "readr", 
                   "rmarkdown", "stringr", "tidyr"))
```
