#### Room C123B

Build on your beginning shiny skills and learn more about the confusing parts of shiny, and the surrounding shiny ecosystem. By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

- Dynamically update controls based on other inputs

- Explain when to use eventReactive versus observeEvent in your code

- Use Quarto Dashboards with Shiny

- Integrate ObservableJS visualizations into your Shiny Applications

- Explain the deployment process to Shinyapps.io and Posit Connect

**Knowledge Prerequisites**: Basic knowledge of shiny apps. If you know how to build this app - <a href= "https://shiny.posit.co/r/gallery/start-simple/single-file-shiny-app/">Single File Shiny App</a>, you should be good to go.

**Pre-Installations**: We will use Posit.Cloud for this workshop, so no installations needed.
