### Taking CRAN to the Next Level with Posit Public Package Manager
Lighting Talk, SESSION TIME HERE, SESSION ROOM HERE

Everyone working in R downloads and installs packages from CRAN to help them build cool things, but most don't even think about where those packages are coming from because "it just works." Posit (the company that brings you RStudio) also provides a free service to the R community that makes working with CRAN packages even easier. In this talk, we'll learn what Posit Public Package Manager is, what extra features and advantages it provides over standard CRAN mirrors, and how easy it is to change your default R repository and start using it.
