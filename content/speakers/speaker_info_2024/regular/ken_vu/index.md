### Drawing a Christmas card with the ggplot2 package
Regular talk, 11:40-11:55

When the elves aren't around to help with the holiday festivities, Santa can always count on R programmers to do the job! After getting my Master's Degree in Statistics last year, I was slowly losing my knowledge of R, which I obtained from my graduate education. Since I enjoyed programming in R so much, I wanted to figure out how to preserve my knowledge of it. At the same time, I wanted to spread some holiday cheer during the Christmas season, which was around the time I began to realize how much I have not kept practicing my R programming skills as much as I used to. Inspired by examples of aRtistry I saw online, I found a way to do both; I drew a Christmas card using R code. It involved rigorous pre-planning, storyboarding, lots of trial and error, and of course, the ggplot2 package to design it. In this talk, I'll explain my entire creative process behind creating this Christmas card with R, and show how it deepened my understanding of the grammar of graphics. This talk shares with the audience a unique way of using R to create R attendees can explore and learn from, which both align with R Cascadia's goal of promoting different uses of R, having learning opportunities, and connect R programmers with one another.
