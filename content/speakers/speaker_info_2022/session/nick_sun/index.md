Hypothesis tests in the medical devices industry are often concerned with probabilities e.g. sensitivity and specificity. Since power curves for these studies exhibit a non-monotonic, sawtooth pattern, power calculations are required for effective study planning. These calculations can be done relatively quickly in R, but this may be limiting for statisticians and scientists with limited R programming experience. At Natera, we have made many of our proportion based power calculations available in a single accessible Shiny dashboard so that users can investigate the relationships between sample size and power, regardless of technical acumen. This app has allowed our statisticians to spend more time participating in meaningful cross team discussion and less time coding repetitive calculations, as well as giving other technical teams a straightforward starting point for sample size discussions.
