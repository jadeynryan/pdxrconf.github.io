The Oregon Department of Transportation recently completed research to better understand the magnitude of disparities of injured pedestrians in the state.  Using R for all of the data wrangling, analysis and visualizations, researchers documented the existing inequities for pedestrian injuries in Oregon.  Multiple analyses were performed that relied on a number of tools and packages within R.  Many of these analyses have been posted to Github to ease the burden for analysts in other states and regions to measure pedestrian injury inequity.  This presentation will highlight the various elements of R utilized in this research and the high level outcomes documented in the research.
