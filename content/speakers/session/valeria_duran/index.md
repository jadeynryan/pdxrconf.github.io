Legacy code is code written by previous programmers, and it is a common scenario that any programmer has come across when initiating a new task. Working with unfamiliar code, especially in the absence of its creator, can be tedious and stressful for any user, and can oftentimes lead to further contribution of legacy code when not taking the proper steps and precautions. There are multiple aspects to consider, such as verifying the code runs, understanding the ins and outs of the code enough to effectively make updates or enhancements for use cases, and finding ways to prevent further contribution to legacy code. To address this issue, many steps can be put in place to facilitate the handling of legacy code, such as using test data to run the code, reviewing of code, comparing code with specifications, and using validated tools and packages for consistency and version control. In this talk, we will present an overview of how SCHARP has implemented protocols to work with legacy code.
