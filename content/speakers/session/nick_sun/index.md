Existing in some iteration since 1976, Vim is the default text editor on many popular operating systems and software tools such as MacOS, Linux, and Git. Relying solely on keyboard shortcuts to navigate and edit text, Vim carries an imposing reputation as a tool for only the most hardcore of programmers. Despite this, the basics can be picked up within a few minutes of practice and even an elementary command of Vim is a useful, fun, and engaging tool for any programming language, including R! This lightning talk will demonstrate some Vim features built into the RStudio IDE that should help anyone who works with data, including easy file navigation, quick editing on whole lines and within brackets, and text macros to automate editing actions. We will conclude with mentions of the very active and welcoming Vim community and recommendations for further resources.
