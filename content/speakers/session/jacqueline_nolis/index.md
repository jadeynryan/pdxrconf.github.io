E-commerce has many components that must be securely handled–managing a user's shopping cart, checking out and taking payment, and fulfilling orders. I am excited to say that I've successfully created an e-commerce platform entirely in a single Shiny app for my side project: {ggirl}. Using the experimental {brochure} package by Colin Fay I was able to make a complex Shiny web service that lets R users order physical postcards of ggplots. I integrated Stripe for payments and used webhooks to know when to fulfill orders. I even used {httr} to make API calls to order the physical products from suppliers after the customer payments are received. In this talk I'll go through the architecture I devised and how you can make an ecommerce platform yourself!
