Adding another programming language for your analytical skill is an important tool set. However, after getting used to R unique dialect, it may be tricky to adapt a different one. It also does not mean you need to neglect the practices that have already proved to be useful in your day-to-day work.

In this talk I will share the painful-but-empowering process I go through by learning Python after years of practicing R. I will share the mindset that helped me to stretch out of my R comfort zone and list best practices that I adopted from R, that will guide me through my journey. Some examples are: use of list comprehensions and Hierarchical indexing (MultiIndex).
