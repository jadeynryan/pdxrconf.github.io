        <h2>Keynotes</h2>
        <h4><a href="https://rglab.github.io/">Raphael Gottardo</a></h4>
        <p>Dr. Gottardo is a pioneer in developing and applying statistical methods and software tools to distill actionable insights from large and complex biological data sets.In partnership with scientists and clinicians, he works to understand such diseases as cancer, HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis and inform the development of vaccines and treatments. He is a leader in forming interdisciplinary collaborations across the Hutch, as well as nationally and internationally, to address important research questions, particularly in the areas of vaccine research, human immunology, and immunotherapy. As director of the Translational Data Science Integrated Research Center, he fosters interaction between the Hutchâ€™s experimental and clinical researchers and their computational and quantitative science colleagues with the goal of transforming patient care through data-driven research. Dr. Gottardo partners closely with the cancer immunotherapy program at Fred Hutch to improve treatments. For example, his team is harnessing cutting-edge computational methods to determine how cancers evade immunotherapy. He has made significant contributions to vaccine research and is the principal investigator of the Vaccine and Immunology Statistical Center of the Collaboration for AIDS Vaccine Discovery.</p>
        <p>Raphael will speak on <em>What big data research will be helpful in the age of medical reversal?</em></p>
